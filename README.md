# Deep Learning Projects using PyTorch

This space is to tune my practical deep learning skills. I will develop various deep learning projects using PyTorch without any Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V and will upload the notebooks here.

1. [Image] Fashion MNIST Dataset - Multi Class Image Classification using modified LeNet [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning/blob/master/fashion-mnist.ipynb)
2. [Text] Language Words Dataset - Multi Class Word Classification using character level LSTM [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning/blob/master/2-multi-class-word-classification.ipynb)
3. [Text] US Baby Names Dataset - Name Generation using character level LSTM [[Link]](https://github.com/GokulKarthik/deep-learning/blob/master/3-baby-name-generation.ipynb)
